# IMPORTANT NOTICES


<a id="org667d2db"></a>

## 1. HEALTH AND WELLNESS

-   Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are continuing to evolve and
    infection and hospitalization rates continue to show depressing
    cycles of surge and fall, at both a local and national level&#x2013;long
    beyond what was hoped almost four years ago.

-   To reduce the risk of infection and increase the possibility of
    wellness allowing us to focus on learning and working together,
    please be monitor your health and be mindful of others around
    you. You are always welcome to wear a mask in class for whatever
    reason and the professor will frequently do so.

-   This is a request for us to think socially about how our choices
    impact others and how we can maximize learning opportunities.
    **Please respect each other's choices on this issue**.


<a id="orga809d66"></a>

## 2. ATTENDANCE, ZOOM AND CLASS RECORDINGS

-   **ZOOM AND CLASS ATTENDANCE WHEN UNWELL** - If you feel sick or are
    showing symptoms of Covid-19, flu or cold then **PLEASE BE
    CONSIDERATE** of your classmates and attend the class remotely
    through Zoom. All class sessions will be available live through Zoom
    (see links in Canvas) and as recordings.

-   Please make use of ****absence notices**** in `Path@Penn` to inform the
    professor if you need to miss class due to extenuating
    circumstances. Submitting an absence notice does not excuse students
    from their course obligations. But you can view missed class session
    in class recordings in Canvas.

<a id="course-description-goals-and-objectives"></a>

# Course Description, Goals and Objectives

-   This course is a general overview of the important components of
    social research, specifically the use of quantitative methods. It
    covers defining research problems, research design, assessing research
    quality, sampling, measurement, and the use of statistical methods.

-   Course activities will include lectures, class exercises, reading
    published scientific articles, using statistical software (R), and
    discussing research featured in the news.

-   Each week one session will be in lecture form and provide background
    for the theory and methods and the second will be a lab session in
    which students will work through exercises using the R programming
    language (we will use a web-based data analysis and programming
    environment called JuypterHub to do this).

-   By completing this course students will:
    -   understand the logic behind social science research applied to
        Communication
    -   be able to view research with a critical eye
    -   have hands-on experience of some of the key methods used in
        quantitative research in Communication
    -   gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the R programming
        language and have completed a number of programming exercises to
        clean, analyze, visualize and interpret data
    -   understand and have practiced the use of basic descriptive and
        inferential statistical methods


<a id="assessment"></a>

# Assessment

-   Quizzes (20%)
    -   Most weeks there will be a short quiz related to the lecture and
        readings for the week. The quiz will be available in Canvas.

-   Lab Assignments (35%)
    -   Weekly lab sessions will focus on learning to use R for data and
        statistical analysis and will include questions to complete and
        submit by Sunday 11.59pm the same week.

-   Two small group mini projects (45%)
    -   These projects will give you a chance gain hands-on experience using
        two of the Communication research methods we will cover in the
        lectures and readings.

1.  Survey measure and analysis (20%)
2.  Content Analysis (25%)

-   More details will be provided as the course progresses.

# Textbooks and recommended readings


<a id="textbooks"></a>

## Textbooks

1.  Scharrer, E. and Ramasubramanian, S. (2021) *Quantitative Research
    Methods in Communication: The Power of Numbers for Social Justice*.
    Routledge (Available online through the library)
    -   There will be weekly readings from this book aligned with the
        topics for the lectures. The quizzes will be primarily based on the
        content of these readings.
    -   This book is referenced as **S&R** in the schedule below.

2.  Wickham, H. and Grolemund. G. (2017) *R for Data Science*. O'Reilly
    Media. (Available online: <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html>)
    -   We will use parts of this book in the lab sessions for learning to
        use R. The book focuses on using `ggplot` for visualization and the
        `tidyverse` libraries for data analysis, just as we will.
    -   There is more advanced material in the book that we won't be able
        to cover but it is well worth spending some time trying some of the
        exercises throughout the chapters.
    -   This book is referenced as **W&G** in the schedule below.

<a id="note-about-learning-programming"></a>

# Note about learning programming

One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop data
analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of carrying
out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a new spoken
language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course
does not require students to have any programming background.
Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer
in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are
focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with
reading, understanding and modifying R code examples that you can find
on the web etc.
