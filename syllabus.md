## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

* This course is a general overview of the important components of social research, specifically the use of quantitative methods. It covers defining research problems, research design, assessing research quality, sampling, measurement, and the use of statistical methods.

* Course activities will include lectures, class exercises, reading published scientific articles, using  statistical software (R), and discussing research featured in the news.

* Each week one session will be in lecture form and provide background for the theory and methods and the second will be a lab session
in which students will work through exercises using RStudio Cloud (a web-based data analysis and programming environment).

* By completing this course students will:
  * understand the logic behind social science research applied to Communication
  * be able to view research with a critical eye
  * have hands-on experience of some of the key methods used in quantitative research in Communication
  * gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the R programming language and have completed a number of programming exercises to clean, analyze, visualize and interpret data
  * understand and have practiced the use of basic descriptive and inferential statistical methods



## Assessment

* Quizzes (20%)
  * Most weeks there will be a short quiz related to the lecture and readings for the week. The quiz will be available in Canvas.


* Lab Assignments (40%)
  * Weekly lab sessions will focus on learning to use R for data and statistical analysis and will include questions to complete and submit by Friday 11.59pm the same week.


* Two small group mini projects (40%)
  * These projects will give you a chance gain hands-on experience using two of the Communication research methods we will cover in the lectures and readings.  
    1. Content Analysis (20%)
    2. Survey measure and analysis (20%)
  * More details will be provided as the course progresses.


### Textbooks and recommended readings

#### Textbooks

1. Scharrer, E. and Ramasubramanian, S. (2021) *Quantitative Research Methods in Communication: The Power of Numbers for Social Justice*. Routledge (Available online through the library)
   * There will be weekly readings from this book aligned with the topics for the lectures. The quizzes will be primarily based on the content of these readings.
   * This book is referenced as __S&R__ in the schedule below.<br/><br/>

2. Wickham, H. and Grolemund. G. (2017) *R for Data Science*. O'Reilly Media.
(Available online: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
    * We will use parts of this book in the lab sessions for learning to use R. The book focuses on using `ggplot` for visualization and the `tidyverse` libraries for data analysis, just as we will.
    * There is more advanced material in the book that we won't be able to cover but it is well worth spending some time trying some of the exercises throughout the chapters.
    * This book is referenced as __W&G__ in the schedule below.<br/><br/>

## Note about learning programming

One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop data analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of carrying out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a new spoken language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and modifying R code examples that you can find on the web etc.
